App demo video : https://youtu.be/e-bW3bXzEZw

For the front end of the application. I used React, javascript, and CSS for styling.
In this app a user can authenticate to this app using their email, password, name and profile photo.
A user can add their visited place. 
The user can upload images of the place and write a title, description and address. 
I used google API to locate the place on google maps for the given address. 
The user can also delete and edit their added place. 
The user can view other users shared places in the app.
